# Training Needs Analysis (TNA) Sample

This sample Training Needs Analysis (TNA) provides a structured, strategic approach for identifying skill gaps and training requirements within an organization. It guides practitioners through the full processâ€”from analyzing training requests to recommending and implementing learning solutions that align with organizational goals.

The analysis focuses on assessing current competencies, defining performance expectations, and developing targeted training solutions to bridge identified gaps.

## Key Components of the TNA Process

- **Organizational Alignment**  
  Ensure that all training recommendations directly support overarching business objectives and strategic initiatives.

- **Skills Gap Analysis**  
  Assess employee competencies against required performance standards to identify areas for development.

- **Data Collection Methods**  
  Use tools such as surveys, interviews, performance evaluations, and job/task analyses to collect comprehensive data.

- **Training Recommendations**  
  Design and propose customized learning solutions based on identified needs, including formats such as e-learning, instructor-led training, job aids, or blended learning.

- **Implementation & Evaluation**  
  Develop strategies for delivering training and measuring its effectiveness through metrics and feedback.

This sample serves as a practical guide for HR professionals, L&D specialists, and business leaders seeking to develop data-driven training programs that enhance workforce performance.
